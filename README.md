# Palmetto

## Background

This is an app written for a coding exercise.

There are comments and todos in the code that explain why certain things were done.

I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The backend is written with NodeJS / Express.

## Setup

If you want to run this, please note you must update the .env file with a correct Accuweather API key

```
ACCUWEATHER_API_KEY=API_GOES_HERE
```

## To Run

In different terminals:

`npm run server` - This starts the backend API

`npm start` - This starts the react app

### Tests

Tests can be run using `npm test`
